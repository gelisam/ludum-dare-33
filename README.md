Treasure Chest Life - Ludum Dare 33
===

In progress.

![An FFII screenshot in which the player opens a box and a message says "Monster-in-a-box!"](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100709014445/finalfantasy/images/5/54/Monster_in_a_box_FFII.png)

My plan is to reference the "Monster-in-a-box!" idiom from Final Fantasy. The theme for Ludum Dare 33 is "You are the Monster", so the twist is that you are a monster living inside a chest and you're constantly getting attacked by explorers who want to steal your treasure. You fight them in a traditional RPG style: fight, magic, items (the contents of the treasure chest?), run (and let the explorers steal the contents of the treasure chest? never!). Except you don't gain XP: instead, you receive visits from stronger and stronger explorers! And maybe get items from the explorers you defeat and keep them in your chest for future fights. The game over message could be "Obtained [list of all your remaining items]!"

You'd win after defeating a predetermined number of explorers, but story-wise, I don't know what would cause them to stop coming.
