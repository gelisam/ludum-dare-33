Treasure Chest Life - Ludum Dare 33
===

In progress.

![An FFII screenshot in which the player opens a box and a message says "Monster-in-a-box!"](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100709014445/finalfantasy/images/5/54/Monster_in_a_box_FFII.png)

My plan is to reference the "Monster-in-a-box!" idiom from Final Fantasy. The theme for Ludum Dare 33 is "You are the Monster", so the twist is that you are a monster living inside a treasure chest and you're constantly getting attacked by the same group of adventurers who want to steal your treasure. You fight them in a traditional RPG style: fight, magic, items, run.

If you win ("Anihilated") or the adventurers run away, you gain some of the items which the adventurers were carrying ("A potion fell into the treasure chest!") and you put them in your treasure chest. You can then use those items during the next fight with the adventurers, after they grinded some more and came back stronger.

If you run away, the adventurers loot all of your items ("Obtained [list of all your remaining items]!" or "It's empty...") and the next fight will thus be harder.

If you lose, the adventurers loot all of your items and you get a save menu in which you can revert to a previous battle. It can be useful to go back to an earlier battle than the most recent one if you think you can manage to use fewer items.

After a predetermined number of fights, the adventurers give up, saying that they have more important things to do (like saving the world). The world is saved, peace is restored, and nobody ever comes bothering you in your treasure chest again, the end. If you ran away from the last fight, you get the bad ending: "But guarding an empty treasure chest is so lame... Try again?"
